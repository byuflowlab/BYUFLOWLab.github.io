  <h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-1">Prospective Undergraduate Researchers</h2>

<p>There are three levels of involvement within the lab.  Everyone will need to start at 1 but may skip some steps depending on their prior experience.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Basic skill development.  If interested in our lab please fill out <a href="https://forms.gle/B1rVMtkj7USjcXpRA">this survey</a>.  Before starting a research project there are some basic skills you will need to develop in reading, writing, programming, and aerodynamics. We have a starter project to guide you through this <a href="https://github.com/byuflowlab/undergrad-onboarding">here</a>.  You will complete these at your own pace.  It is expected to take a couple weeks for a student with previous programming experience.  For a freshmen it may take a semester or two.   While completing the mini-project you should start to learn more about the research in the lab.  You’ll want to get to know some of the graduate students and the projects they working on.  Attend our group meetings if possible (contact me or any of the <a href="../people">students</a>) to learn when current meetings are held).  Visit with students after meetings or in the lab, learn more about ongoing <a href="../research">research projects</a> and look through some of the relevant <a href="../publications">publications</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First research project (course credit).  When you have identified some areas of interest, talk to the graduate students in that area to learn more about what they are doing and what needs they might have.  Almost all of our undergraduate hiring is driven by the graduate students needs, so you should go through them first to find opportunities.  Once you have identified a potential research area or two in collaboration with one of the graduate students, send me a couple of paragraphs describing the proposed project and schedule an appointment to come visit (preferably with the graduate student).  Once we settle on a direction, you will then need to create a syllabus for the upcoming semester. Your syllabus should contain a week-to-week description of tasks, deliverables, and a reading/learning schedule.  Your graduate student mentor will help you develop this.  Readings should come from journal papers recommended by the graduate student and textbook/course resources listed below under Reading and Learning.  ME 497R is usually the ideal route for a new researcher.  Registering for ME 497R opens up time in your schedule for research, and the course fulfills a tech elective towards graduation.  Registering for 3 credits requires about 10 hours of work per week.  The course is graded, and you will be expected to produce an end-of-semester report. Follow the <a href="https://me.byu.edu/students/resources">BYU ME writing guidelines</a>.  It should be written in the style of a scientific conference paper.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Undergraduate research assistant (paid).  After successfully completing a 497R, or with prior relevant research experience in another lab, you are eligible for a paid position.  You will continue to work with your graduate student mentor to define goals for the semester and produce end-of-semester reports leading towards conference presentations and journal publications.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<!-- Completing a 497R in our lab usually leads to a paid position.  Those with more experience (either through other research labs, relevant internships, or coursework) may choose to apply directly to a paid position.   -->

<!-- ### How to get involved -->

<!-- ME 273 is a prerequisite for all of our projects.  Some projects might require additional prerequisites like ME 312. -->

<!-- There are three ways to get involved: volunteer, ME 497R, or a paid position.  We generally discourage the volunteering route as it is difficult to maintain with a busy undergraduate schedule.  ME 497R is usually the ideal route for new researchers.  Registering for ME 497R opens up time in your schedule for research, and the course fulfills a tech elective towards graduation.  Registering for 3 credits requires at least 9 hours of work per week (2 credits for 6 hours is also possible).  The course is graded, and you will be expected to produce an end-of-semester report.  Completing a 497R in our lab usually leads to a paid position.  Those with more experience (either through other research labs, relevant internships, or coursework) may choose to apply directly to a paid position.   -->

<!-- Most paid positions require a minimum one-year commitment (we also commit to you).  Our goal is to help each undergraduate student to contribute to impactful research publications.  It takes a semester or two just to get up to speed, and so short-term research commitments are significantly less effective.  This commitment is another reason why we recommend completing a 497R first.  The 497R project does not require any long-term commitment and gives both you and us a chance to see if a longer term role is a good fit. -->

<p>If you are interested in pursuing graduate work in our lab upper level mathematics and programming courses beyond the normal ME curriculum will be particularly helpful.  ME 415, ME 515, and ME 575 are most directly relevant to our research topics, but it might be better to save the latter two for when you are a graduate student (4XX level or below courses won’t count towards your graduate degree).</p>

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-2">New Graduate Students</h2>

<p>Your goal as a researcher is to make an impact for good in the world and improve the way we design wind and flight systems.  The primary way to make an impact is through tackling challenging and important questions, performing high-quality insightful work, collaborating with industry and other researchers, and sharing findings broadly at conferences and in peer-reviewed journals.</p>

<p>Our lab handbook is available <a href="https://github.com/byuflowlab/grad-handbook">here</a>.  All new researchers in our group should become familiar with this guide and review it annually.    Write down your questions so that we can discuss them during our next meeting.  Many of these topics will be relevant to undergraduates in our lab as well.</p>

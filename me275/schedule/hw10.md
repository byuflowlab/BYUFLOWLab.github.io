1. The file [osteoporosis.csv] contains information about individuals with and without osteoporosis and can be used to predict whether or not someone is at risk for osteoporosis based on their lifestyle. Assuming the data represents a simple random sample, find the 99% confidence interval for the proportion of individuals that have osteoporosis.

1. You are conducting research on the tensile strength of titanium. You perform tensile tests on 10 samples and obtain the following tensile strengths in ksi: [34.5 35.3 33.8 35.8 37.0 37.5 35.6 34.4 33.2 38.0]
First, you must verify that using the Studentâ€™s t Distribution is appropriate for this data set. This can be done quickly by graphing the data to check if the distribution is approximately normal and if there are any outliers. Generate a box plot of the data.
For your research, you need to determine the average tensile strength of titanium. Estimate the average tensile strength along with the 95% confidence interval.

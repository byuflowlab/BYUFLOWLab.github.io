    <p>A certain type of stainless steel powder is supposed to have a mean particle diameter of \(\mu\) = 15 \(\mu\)m. A random sample of 87 particles had a mean diameter of 15.2 \(\mu\)m, with a standard deviation of 1.8 \(\mu\)m. A test is made of \(H_0\): \(\mu\) = 15 versus \(H_a\) : \(\mu \ne\) 15.  Find the p-value.</p>

    <p>You purchased a filling machine for candy bags that is supposed to fill each bag with 16 oz of candy. Assume that the weights of filled bags are approximately normally distributed. A random sample of 10 bags yields the following data (in oz):</p>

    <p>The article “Utility of Pretest Probability and Exercise Treadmill Test in Korean Women with Suspected Coronary Artery Disease” (Y. Kim, W. Shim, et al., Journal of Women’s Health, 2015:617–622) presents a study of health outcomes in women with symptoms of heart disease. In a sample of 110 women whose test results suggested the presence of coronary artery disease, the mean peak systolic blood pressure was 169.9 mmHg, with a standard deviation of 24.8 mmHg. In a sample of 225 women whose test results suggested an absence of coronary artery disease, the mean peak systolic blood pressure was 163.3 mmHg, with a standard deviation of 25.8 mmHg.  <!-- (7.1, 10) --></p>

    <p>a) Find a 95% confidence interval for the difference in systolic blood pressure between these two groups of women.</p>

    <p>An automobile manufacturer wishes to compare the lifetimes of two brands of tire. She obtains samples of six tires of each brand. On each of six cars, she mounts one tire of each brand on each front wheel. The cars are driven until only 20% of the original tread remains. The distances, in miles, for each tire are presented in the following table. Can you conclude that there is a difference between the mean lifetimes of the two brands of tire?  State the appropriate null and alternate hypotheses, find the p-value, and state your conclusion.  <!-- 7.4, 9 --></p>

    <p>Many companies have been experimenting with telecommuting, allowing employees to work at home on their computers. Among other things, telecommuting is supposed to reduce the number of sick days taken. Suppose that at one firm, it is known that over the past few years employees have taken a mean of 5.4 sick days. This year, the firm introduces telecommuting. Management chooses a simple random sample of 80 employees to follow in detail, and, at the end of the year, these employees average 4.5 sick days with a standard deviation of 2.7 days. Let \(\mu\) represent the mean number of sick days for all employees of the firm.  Find the P-value for testing \(H_0\) : \(\mu \ge\) 5.4 versus \(H_a\): \(\mu &lt;\) 5.4.   <!-- 6.1, 1 --></p>

<!-- 1. The file [osteoporosis.csv] contains information about individuals with and without osteoporosis and can be used to predict whether or not someone is at risk for osteoporosis based on their lifestyle. Assuming the data represents a simple random sample, find the 99% confidence interval for the proportion of individuals that have osteoporosis.

1. You are conducting research on the tensile strength of titanium. You perform tensile tests on 10 samples and obtain the following tensile strengths in ksi: [34.5 35.3 33.8 35.8 37.0 37.5 35.6 34.4 33.2 38.0]
First, you must verify that using the Student’s t Distribution is appropriate for this data set. This can be done quickly by graphing the data to check if the distribution is approximately normal and if there are any outliers. Generate a box plot of the data.
For your research, you need to determine the average tensile strength of titanium. Estimate the average tensile strength along with the 95% confidence interval. -->

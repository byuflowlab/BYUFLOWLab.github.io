      <h2 id="project-overview">Project Overview</h2>

<p>The goal of the project is to work as team to design, build, and fly a small unmanned aerial vehicle to complete a specified mission.</p>

<p><strong>Team</strong>: You will self-select a team of 5.  Choose one person to be a team lead.  Defining other roles of specialization is often helpful, but is at your discretion.</p>

<p><strong>Mission</strong>: This year’s mission is called glider golf!  It’s basically discus golf, but with an airplane.  The three “baskets” will be fairly far apart so you’ll need to design an aircraft than can glide well and is stable.  You’ll also need to predict and measure your lift-to-drag ratio.  An uncontrolled glider is perfectly acceptable.  If you want to do more, you can add a receiver, servos, and control surfaces to control your glider, or you can even go beyond that and size a motor/propeller system to have a powered aircraft. Your performance won’t be measured by the complexity of the aircraft, but rather on how well your airplanes glides when unpowered (L/D) and on how well you can complete the mission (low golf score).  We’ll have two fly off days and you will be allowed two attempts each day.</p>

<!-- **Mission**: This year's mission is centered on a banner-towing bush plane (motivated by a simplified version of this year's [AIAA DBF competition](https://www.aiaa.org/dbf)).  Your airplane needs to carry a banner, climb 30 meters AGL (above ground level), pass through three waypoints along your route, and safely land.  You'll need to predict and measure some performance metrics like climb rate, lift-to-drag ratio, energy usage, and time to complete mission. The aircraft will have a GPS and a telemetry radio onboard to broadcast data to a ground station computer. -->

<!-- This year's mission is motivated by package delivery applications like Amazon Prime Air or Google Project Wing, but will be simplified for the purposes of a class.  The mission is to carry a 100 gram payload, climb 30 meters AGL (above ground level), fly at 30 m AGL (+/- 5m) for 500 meters, reach two waypoints within a tolerance of 10 meters where the packages would be delivered (we won't actually deliver the payload as that is the worst-case scenario for aircraft sizing and simplifies logistics), then descend, unpowered, for a safe landing. -->

<!-- Your aircraft will be assessed against several performance metrics: climb rate, lift-to-drag ratio, and energy used as measured by the change in battery state of charge.  Your goal is to show good agreement between your calculations and the flight data.  Extra credit will be given to the team with the best performance in each of the three categories.  The aircraft will have a GPS and a telemetry radio onboard to broadcast data to a ground station computer.   -->

<p><strong>Safety</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you choose to use a powered aircraft you will need to review the <a href="https://www.faa.gov/uas/recreational_fliers/">FAA guidelines</a> for model aircraft, and register your aircraft.</li>
  <li><strong>Always</strong> be in the room when charging batteries, and charge them inside the LiPo charging bag.  They are a potential fire hazard if left unattended.  If your battery develops a bulge, do not use it!</li>
  <li>Never drain a battery completely (i.e., don’t leave it plugged into your speed controller overnight).  Otherwise, it will no longer hold a charge.</li>
  <li>Don’t design an airplane larger than 1 kg.  Most gliders will be around 300-600 g and powered aircraft in the range of 400-900 g.  Heavier aircraft require more powerful motors with faster propellers and we don’t want to expose you to unnecessary risks in this class.</li>
  <li>Don’t exceed 20 m/s ground speed at any time.</li>
  <li>Don’t fly when it is windy or gusty.  Early morning is often a good time to avoid wind.</li>
  <li>Double check that batteries are unplugged before swapping out a prop.  Keep your hands away from props anytime the aircraft is powered.</li>
  <li>Wear safety glasses when working with tools in the lab.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Flying</strong>: If you have a glider you should be able to fly it on your own.  If you have a powered aircraft one or more of your team members may train to be a pilot if desired.  We have a flight simulator with a transmitter in the Airplane Lab that you can use to practice.  Alternatively, we can connect you with students who are able pilots, but you will need to arrange flying schedules with them.  The resources page contains information on how to certify as a pilot, as well as a pre-flight check list.</p>

<!-- **Design**: Some of the components will be provided via a kit.  Everything else about the design is up to you!   -->

<!-- Because the autopilot will be relatively basic, you will need to create a reasonably stable and efficient aircraft. -->

<p><strong>Materials</strong>: We have receivers and transmitters you can borrow if you choose to use them.  You will need to purchase supplies for the construction of your aircraft and optionally a speed controller(s), motor(s), propellers, servos, and push rods.   The nature of these materials is up to you but typical materials include foam, carbon rods, balsa or bass wood, 3D printing, etc.  In our workspace we provide various tools and adhesives.  We will also provide some commonly-used materials that you can purchase at cost if you wish.</p>

<!-- We will provide a kit that you will purchase containing a GPS unit, telemetry radio, and a receiver.   -->

<!-- Raspberry Pi, flight controller, GPS unit, and receiver, all of which must be cared for and turned in at the end of class.  You will purchase (and keep) a kit of shorter-lasting components: speed controllers, motors, propellers, servos, push rods, etc.  You will also need to purchase supplies for the construction of your aircraft.   -->

<p><strong>Deliverables</strong>: There will be a preliminary design review, a critical design review, and a final presentation.  Rubrics and milestones will be provided for each of these, with a relatively low weight in points.  They are mostly milestones to make sure you are on target and to learn from one another.  There main deliverable is the final report.  Details on the final report are linked on the class schedule.</p>

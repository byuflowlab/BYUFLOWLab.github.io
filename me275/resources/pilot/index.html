<h2 id="pilot-certification">Pilot Certification</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Simulator Certification.  Practice on the simulator in the Airplane Lab.  When ready, pass off to the TA.  You will need to use a model with similar controls to yours.  The TA will ask you to: take-off, demonstrate well-controlled orbits, and land.  These tasks will then be repeated with wind/gusts.  Finally, you will need to demonstrate recovery from stalls and spins.</li>
  <li>Live Certification.  Using a trainer (or your plane) fly with a “buddy box” (controlled by the TA), perform similar tasks as in the simulator.  Then perform a solo flight.</li>
  <li>Review safety/procedures with the TAs.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once certified, you are free to checkout the transmitters.  Be sure to fill out the check-out sheet.</p>

<h2 id="pre-flight-checklist-and-rules">Pre-Flight Checklist and Rules</h2>

<p><strong>Safety is the most important consideration.</strong>  Do not take unnecessary risks.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Check surroundings. Is it safe to fly?  Is it windy?  Are there too many people around?</li>
  <li>Check cg location.</li>
  <li>Check that electronic components are secure.</li>
  <li>Perform a visual inspection of plane including props and control surface attachments.  If adjusting props make sure battery is off.</li>
  <li>Turn on transmitter</li>
  <li>Make sure throttle is all the way down to zero.</li>
  <li>Plug in battery</li>
  <li>Check that the propellers are spinning in the correct direction.</li>
  <li>Check that the control surfaces move in the expected directions.</li>
  <li>Have another team member prepare to launch.  Establish a countdown, throttle up, and launch into the wind.</li>
</ol>

<p>Other Rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ask someone on your team to be the ground spotter (to make sure you aren’t flying over people), and if possible have a sky spotter (to look for other planes/trees, etc. and to double check orientation).</li>
  <li>Fly above 100 ft.  Flying higher will give you more time to recover.  Don’t fly low!</li>
  <li>Don’t fly when it is windy.</li>
  <li>Never take your eyes off your plane.</li>
  <li>Land towards yourself (preferably within 20 feet of you).</li>
  <li>If anything looks off or is drifting out of range, take over manual control immediately.</li>
  <li>Make sure you can fly without the payload before adding it.</li>
</ul>

<!-- 
## Autopilot

The autopilots are the most expensive component, and building your plane took a lot of time and effort.  You reduce the risk of damaging either through a careful progressive testing process.

- Fly new designs RC first for several flights.  Don't put the autopilot on board.  Use the dummy pod (same size and weight).
- Simulate RC flights using Gazebo.  Gazebo will allow you to run your autopilot with the same software, but in a simulated environment.
- Test new autopilot algorithms on the ground first.  Walk around with your plane and observe control surfaces and throttle settings.  Make sure it does what you expect.

<h2 id="transmitter">Transmitter</h2>

<p>Download the <a href="https://img.banggood.com/file/products/20170105005757X7%E8%AF%B4%E6%98%8E%E4%B9%A6.pdf">manual</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Binding Receivers</strong>.  This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngzWn0WlxLE">video</a> has instructions for binding our receivers in ppm mode (don’t worry that it’s a different transmitter, the firmware is exactly the same).  You should only have to do this once, and the TA will probably be there, but the video is there just for your reference.</p>

<p>If you want to bind the receiver in PWM mode, (for RC flight with a dummy pod), the binding procedure is exactly the same, except you don’t put a jumper on channels 3 and 4.  See this video for reference: https://youtu.be/aDZjEpZ-ut0?t=1m4s  (stop at 3:30).</p>

<p><strong>Switches</strong>.  See the first figure in the manual.  For the instructions below “up” is away from you or up, “down” is toward you or down, center is between up and down (for 3 position switches).</p>
<ul>
  <li>Autopilot Override: SF 2-position switch
    <ul>
      <li>Up gives autopilot control (you can still give inputs on the sticks though, so be careful)</li>
      <li>Down gives you total RC control</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Motor Arm/Disarm: SA 3-position switch
    <ul>
      <li>Up/Center: Disarmed</li>
      <li>Down: Armed</li>
    </ul>

    <p>*note: neither you nor the autopilot can use the throttle until you arm it.</p>

    <p>*note: for the autopilot to have control of throttle, the motor must be armed, the autopilot must be engaged, and the throttle stick must be at maximum (all the way up).</p>
  </li>
  <li>Dual Rates (well, there are 3 settings, so Tri Rates?): SD 3-position switch
    <ul>
      <li>Up: 100% throw</li>
      <li>Center: 67% throw</li>
      <li>Down: 34% throw</li>
    </ul>

    <p>*note: throttle is unaffected by this switch, but everything else is.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Battery Voltage Indicator: SH 2-position toggle switch
    <ul>
      <li>this may or may not happen, but if it does, it will announce your battery voltage.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>*note: all flight modes are set to “exponential.”  You probably won’t notice, but basically it’s designed to make it easier for you to fly.  If you’re curious what’s going on in the background, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skU51E5ilG0">this video</a> explains it.</p>

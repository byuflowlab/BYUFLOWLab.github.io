<p><img src="andrew.jpg" alt="Andrew Ning" class="person" /></p>

<p><strong>Andrew Ning</strong> is interested in the complex tradeoffs that occur in engineering design.  The design of wind energy and flight systems involves strong interactions across multiple disciplines.  Optimization and machine learning are useful tools in exploring these design decisions.  In addition to design applications, he is interested in developing fundamental algorithms and methodologies for efficient aerodynamic analysis and optimization.</p>

<p>Dr. Ning received his PhD and MS degrees from Stanford University in the Aircraft Aerodynamics and Design Group.  After graduation he worked at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory on wind turbine aeroelastic analysis and optimization (where he currently holds a joint appointment).  He loves engaging in ideas and learning with the excellent students and faculty at BYU.  Outside of engineering he enjoys mountain biking, soccer, basketball, and reading.</p>

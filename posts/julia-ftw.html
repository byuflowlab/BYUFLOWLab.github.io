  <h1 class="post-title">Julia for the Win</h1>
  <span class="post-date">16 May 2016, Andrew Ning</span>
  <p>In updating a paper to prepare for journal submission I needed to revisit the accompanying Julia code.  I chose Julia at the time because this was a mostly self-contained project and I wanted to give Julia a trial run on something of moderate complexity (see <a href="http://flow.byu.edu/posts/julia-first-imp">first impressions</a>).  I cleaned up the code, added some capabilities, and really tried to improve performance.  I read all the primary documentation on Julia, including the sections on performance, updated to 0.4.x, explicitly declared all types, and profiled quite a bit.  This made some difference, but my code was still about an order of magnitude slower than a Python/Fortran version.</p>

<p>The original version was mostly Fortran so I wasn’t necessarily seeking a speed improvement.  For the benefits of working in one language I would be ok with a 20-30% slowdown.  However, an order of magnitude slow down was a lot and it really bogged things down when creating figures and data for the paper.  I had about given up on performance, but two separate encounters with Julia-using colleagues made me revisit the topic once again.  I sent my code to a colleague who had been using Julia for some time.  His PhD student pointed out some suggestions, which I tried, but the impact was negligible.</p>

<p>Profiling suggested that a lot of time was spent in conversion between PyCall and scipy.  I tried using the lower-level calls in PyCall to be more explicit in the types, but it didn’t help.  I was using PyCall because I needed an N-dimensional root solver and nothing was available in native Julia.  Roots.jl was available, but it only solves 1-dimensional root finding problems.  PyCall allowed me to call Python’s scipy.optimize.root, which was quite convenient.</p>

<p>When I first wrote this code a year or so ago I directly wrapped the Fortran code hybrd from minpack (using Julia 0.2.x and 0.3.x), which is what is used in Scipy’s root finder.  I later discovered PyCall and that was way more convenient with no real change in computation time.  However, I noted that a lot of improvements were made to ccall and cfunction in 0.4.x so I thought I’d try the direct route again.  I reverted to my direct wrapper of hybrd (with a few minor updates to comply with 0.4.x), to eliminate the Python middleman.  Performance problem solved!   After that change I found that the Julia code was actually 3X faster than the Python/Fortran version!</p>

<p>The other problem I had was that plotting and just running Julia in general was painfully slow.  I was using a Python-like workflow where I would just run the full script each time (using Sublime Text or the terminal).  I knew that Julia had a REPL, but I couldn’t stand working in the browser as opposed to a text editor.  Sometimes with plotting I would use the REPL, but it was a real pain switching back and forth.  My colleague informed me about <a href="https://github.com/JunoLab/atom-ink">Ink</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/JunoLab/atom-julia-client">Julia Client in Atom</a> and it changed everything.  With this tool I could avoid the recompilation of packages and code that before was occurring on every run.</p>

<p>I’m now very happy with using Julia and for one of our new major research projects we are going all in.  Everything isn’t perfect.  Some libraries are nonexistent (although wrapping Fortran/C libraries is pretty easy), and the Atom Julia Client is still a bit rough around the edges and could use a debugger.  But overall, working within one language that is both performant and is very easy to work with is a big win for us.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 80%;">
P.S. If interested in the mentioned code, I have open-sourced it and it is available on <a href="https://github.com/byuflowlab/vawt-ac">GitHub</a>.  It computes aerodynamic loading for multiple vertical axis wind turbines using an extended version of actuator cylinder theory.  A preprint of the accompanying theory is available on <a href="/publications">this website</a> under “Actuator Cylinder Theory for Multiple Vertical Axis Wind Turbines”.

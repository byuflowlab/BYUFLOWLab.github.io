    <!-- <h1 class="page-title">Final Report</h1> -->
      <h2 id="final-report">Final Report</h2>

<h3 id="format">Format</h3>

<p>Your report must be in PDF format, be no more than 10 pages (not including references), and contain the typical elements of a journal paper including an abstract, introduction (including a discussion of prior work), methodology (in sufficient detail that a practitioner could reproduce your results), results (including a detailed discussion on their meaning and relevance), conclusion, and references.  If you have lots of symbols you might consider providing a nomenclature section. Format your paper in the journal style of your field (i.e., don’t just use default LaTeX or Word format).  If you don’t have a particular field, you can use the <a href="http://www.aiaa.org/Secondary.aspx?id=4597">AIAA style</a> (or here on <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/template-for-aiaa-technical-conference-papers/ypfwqxdnntwp">Overleaf</a>).  Most journals (including AIAA) provide LaTeX style files and/or MS Word templates.</p>

<h3 id="writing">Writing</h3>

<p>The quality and clarity of your writing is important.  Your career will likely involve lots of writing.  I encourage you to solicit feedback early and often.  The <a href="http://writingcenter.byu.edu">BYU Writing Center</a> is one excellent resource available to you.  Peer feedback can also be quite helpful.</p>

<h3 id="open-science">Open Science</h3>

<p>The final deliverable should be made publicly available unless extenuating circumstances apply (like working with proprietary data, in which case you need to obtain prior approval with me). Why? You tend to produce higher quality work with a public audience, and you will be able to make a more significant impact for good.  When complete, submit your report to a public archive.  Recommended options include <a href="https://figshare.com">figshare</a> and <a href="https://zenodo.org">zenodo</a>.  Where possible I encourage you to also post code/data for a more significant impact and higher reproducibility.</p>

<p>Some of you may want to submit your work to a conference or journal down the road, and may be concerned about prior publication or getting scooped.  Almost all publishers do not consider the posting of preprints or research outputs online as prior publication.  However, if you have any concerns, both archives  provide an embargo option.  This allows you to submit your work, but select a user-defined future time on when the content should publicly appear.  If you wish to set an embargo then be sure to embargo the file(s) only and not the whole item.  Confer with your advisor/co-authors and select whatever period of embargo time you are comfortable with.</p>

<h3 id="submission">Submission</h3>

<p>Submit the following via Learning Suite by 11:59 PM:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A link to your archived report in the format below.  This is a markdown link, so please follow this format exactly including use of brackets and spacing.  Also be sure to provide the DOI style link meaning your URL should begin with https://dx.doi.org/ as shown below.<br />
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">- [Title of Article in Title Case](https://dx.doi.org/... this is the url to your report) by Author One, Author Two, and Author Three.</code></li>
  <li>The PDF or a private link to your report (only necessary if there is an embargo or you received approval for private submission).</li>
  <li>An approximate percentage breakdown in effort for yourself and the rest of your team members (total must add up to 100%).
<!-- 4. A description of any work included in your report that was done previous to this semester, or that contains contributions from people outside your project team. --></li>
</ol>

<p>Some of you will have final reports that will be nearly publication ready.  If appropriate, I encourage you to consider spending the effort after the class is over to prepare your work for submission to a conference or journal.</p>

<h3 id="grading">Grading</h3>

<p>The final report will be graded using the same criteria that I would use in evaluating a prospective journal article.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Relevance:</strong> Is this a relevant problem of importance in your field of interest?  Is there sufficient literature review to support the relevance of the problem and put it in context?</li>
  <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Is the work novel and a potentially useful contribution to the field?  Is this impact clearly demonstrated (e.g., showing improvements to an existing or baseline design/process, demonstration with actual data, etc.)?  Is the work reproducible?  Is there sufficient detail that another researcher could read your paper and reproduce your results? (Posting code along with your PDF makes the reproducibility part pretty much automatic, but a solid description of methodology with equations and parameter values also works.)</li>
  <li><strong>Quality:</strong> Is the work of good quality and technically accurate?  Do the optimization approaches conform to best practices?  Is an optimal solution just presented, or is its meaning and implications also discussed and explored?  Is the problem well-scoped for the team size?</li>
  <li><strong>Writing:</strong> Is the writing clear and logical?  Are figures and tables well-presented?  Is the paper well organized?</li>
</ul>

<p>You will be asked to rate your contribution and that of your peers (as a percentage).  You will be penalized if you contributed significantly less than expected.  In almost all cases this is not an issue.</p>

<!-- I do not expect a perfect balance, but do expect a balance within +/-5% (e.g., 45/55 for a 2-person team would be considered balanced).     -->

<!-- To compute your project score I will first compute a separate team score.  Then I will average the contribution estimates from all team members and then give you the benefit of the doubt with an added 5% uncertainty margin.  Your score will be computed using this formula: -->
<!-- ![score](../score.svg) -->

<!-- For example, suppose you were on a 3-person team and your team score was 98%.  If you contributed at least 28.3% or greater than your individual score would also be 98%.  But if you contributed less (e.g., say 25%) then your score would be -->
<!-- 98% (25+5)/(33.3) = 88% -->

<!-- \begin{equation*}
    98% \left(\frac{25+5}{33.3}\right) = 88%
\end{equation*}
 -->
<!-- \begin{equation*}
    \text{individual score} = \text{team score} \times \min\left(\frac{\text{contribution + 5\%}}{\text{expected contribution}}, 1\right)
\end{equation*} -->

<!-- Each team members needs to fill out and submit the ``Final Project Supplemental Form'' that is posted on Learning Suite.  This form allows you to detail your role and contributions from others.  You will not receive a grade for your final project until your supplemental form is submitted. -->

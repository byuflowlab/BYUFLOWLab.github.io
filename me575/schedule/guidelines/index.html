<h2 id="format">Format</h2>

<p>All homework must be submitted in report format. A series of equations and “solutions” is insufficient.  Each report should introduce the problem and any assumptions, detail the methodology, and discuss the significance and limitations of the results and conclusions.  Use full sentences, not bullet points.  Imagine your audience to be a colleague or supervisor—someone who understands your field but is not necessarily familiar with the details of your particular problem.  Your report should not only be technically correct, but should also be written clearly and follow best practices in technical writing.</p>

<p>Each report has a page limit of 10 pages. A title page is not necessary, but be sure to write your name on the first page. I recommend using LaTeX to produce your reports (more on this below), but you are also welcome to use Microsoft Word and MS Equation Editor or any other typesetting/word-processing program that you prefer.</p>

<p>Why a report format?  You will learn deeper by having to explain in words, it will better prepare you for the type of work you will have in an engineering career, and the hard work you did will be much more accessible to you when referring to it later.</p>

<p>You will also need to submit any source code that you developed.  You should <strong>not</strong> include source code directly in your report, but you may refer to it from your report if necessary. Source code should be commented so that it is easily readable.</p>

<h2 id="submission-instructions">Submission Instructions</h2>

<p>Each submission should consist of one <strong>PDF</strong> file for the report and one zipped directory containing any auxiliary material (e.g., source code). On Learning Suite you can upload multiple items, just upload them one right after the other.  Nothing is overwritten even though it only shows you your last submitted file. If you are really worried about it, you can upload everything in one zip, but it makes it easier for us to grade if the PDF is separate.</p>

<h2 id="latex">LaTeX</h2>

<p>LaTeX is widely used in scientific writing and if you are doing graduate work you will likely need to learn it at some point (check with your advisor, some research groups prefer MS Word).  To be clear, there is nothing wrong with using Microsoft Word (or an equivalent) for your report preparation.  These are just tools, what’s more important is doing good work.</p>

<p>If you want to use LateX, <a href="https://www.overleaf.com">Overleaf</a> is a good place to start unless you already have a workflow you are comfortable with.  It is like Google Docs for LaTeX.  There isn’t anything to install, and multiple people can work collaboratively (nice for your project).  It also provides a lot of starter templates, in fact I’ve created a simple <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/examples/a-simple-example-for-me-en-575/tmvvshzxypsj">overleaf example</a> for you that illustrates most of the commands you will use.  Many LaTeX tutorials/guides exist online if you need to do anything fancier.</p>

<!-- You might find some of this post I wrote on [Writing Scientific Papers](http://flow.byu.edu/posts/writing-sci-papers/) useful.  Below is a very simple starter example: -->

<!-- ## Writing Tips

- Pay careful attention to the presentation of your figures. Clear figures go a long way. At the same time, a figure is not an answer. Be sure to explain all of your results.
- All figures and tables should use descriptive captions/text, and captions should be full sentences (address the "what" and the "so-what").
- Plots should have properly labeled axes and data (including units), and use readable font sizes.
- Use plot types appropriately. 3D plots are rarely helpful. Avoid things like suppressed zeros, or overly cluttered figures.
- Try to use vector graphics (pdf or eps), not bitmaps (jpg, bmp, png). If you must use a bitmapped figure, use a high resolution version.
- If you use variables and symbols that would not be immediately recognizable in the context of our class be sure to define them.
- It is not necessary to rewrite sections from the textbook if simply referring to them will suffice.
- Avoid passive voice.
- Eliminate wordiness.
- Spellcheck! -->

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-1">Objective</h2>

<p>To engage in deep learning of fluid dynamics principles, prepare you to be amongst the world’s most influential engineers, and build habits of lifelong learning.</p>

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-2">Overview</h2>

<p>This course is intended to reinforce principles covered in ME EN 312, expose you to new fluid mechanics principles, and apply these principles to a variety of interesting fluid dynamic applications (e.g., aircraft, wind turbines, flow around an island, dolphins, etc.).  This class will introduce you to several new topics that you may elect to pursue in more depth through other department offerings: applied aerodynamics (415), gas turbine and jet engine design (426), compressible fluid flow (510), intermediate fluid dynamics (512), computational fluid dynamics (541).  As the title of the class suggests, our focus is developing an understanding of fluid dynamics by studying various applications.</p>

<!-- Many of the applications will require computational simulation (both tools that you develop as well as existing tools), and we will perform experiments where possible. -->

<p>At this stage I expect you to take charge of your own education.  What you take away from the course will greatly depend on your attitude, diligence, initiative, and willingness to work with and learn from others.</p>

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-3">Prerequisites</h2>

<p>You are required to have taken ME EN 312 or some other undergraduate course in fluid mechanics.  While not formally required, it is <em>strongly</em> recommended that you have been exposed to numerical methods and computer programming (e.g., ME EN 273)</p>

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-4">Learning Outcomes</h2>

<p>
   <strong>Governing Equations</strong>
</p>

<p>Understand and be able to apply conservation of mass, momentum, and energy in differential and integral form to fluid dynamics problems.</p>

<p>
   <strong>External Flow</strong>
</p>

<p>Be able to predict lift and drag for bodies in external flow fields using computational and empirical methods.  Understand important viscous behavior like boundary layer growth, transition, separation, and wake development and their implications for performance and design.</p>

<p>
   <strong>Compressible Flow</strong>
</p>

<p>Be able to solve quasi-one-dimensional compressible flow problems including the effects of area change and Mach number.  Understand the behavior of shocks and expansion fans.</p>

<p>
   <strong>Turbomachines</strong>
</p>

<p>Be able to predict performance and understand fundamental design principles for various turbomachinery applications (e.g, jet engines, wind turbines, propellers, compressors).</p>

<p>
   <strong>Computational Fluid Dynamics</strong>
</p>

<p>Become familiar with the basic terminology and methods of CFD including equation discretization, mesh generation, boundary conditions, convergence behavior, and post-processing.  Be able to use CFD software to simulate basic fluid flow applications.</p>

<!-- The learning outcomes for this course are listed [here](https://learningoutcomes.byu.edu/Instructors/course-instructors/11133/000/ME+EN+412/394998/1135). -->

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-6">Course Work</h2>

<p>Please keep in mind the level of time commitment expected (from the <a href="http://registrar.byu.edu/catalog/2011-2012ucat/GeneralInfo/Registration.php">registrar's office</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The expectation for undergraduate courses is three hours of work per week per credit hour for the average student who is appropriately prepared; much more time may be required to achieve excellence.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="participation">Participation</h3>

<p>Good: attend class regularly and punctually.<br />
Better: attend and be attentive in class.<br />
Best: attend, be attentive, and <strong>actively participate</strong> in the classroom discussion.  </p>

<p>Don’t be afraid to ask what you think might be a simple question, usually someone else is wondering the same thing and you are doing them a favor by asking.  Be respectful of your peers and arrive to class on time (but if you are late please don't feel like you can't come in).  You may use electronic devices in the classroom only if they are being used appropriately for class activities (e.g., taking notes).  </p>

<h3 id="reading">Reading</h3>

<p>Most class periods will have an assigned reading, and I expect you to complete the readings beforehand.  I cannot, not would it be effective to, cover all the content you need to know in class.  Instead, class time will be used for discussing difficult concepts, diving deeper into or expanding on concepts you were exposed to in your reading, answering questions, working examples together, and testing understanding.  Readings will come from <em>Fundamentals of Fluid Mechanics</em> by Munson, Okiishi, Huebsch, and Tohmayer (7th Ed.), as well as notes that I will provide.  </p>

<!-- Notes are provided in the form of Jupyter notebooks.  These notebooks provide interactive examples to aid in your concept mastery. -->

<h3 id="homework">Homework</h3>

<p>Homework will typically be due every Wednesday before class and will be turned in via Learning Suite.  Late homework will be accepted with a penalty of 25% per day.  We will grade the homework in a timely manner and provide you with feedback to assist in your learning.  Homework will involve a mix of traditional textbook problems, computational implementation and analysis, experimental data gathering and processing, and the use of computational fluid dynamics software.</p>

<p>Assignments are expected to be produced in report format.  A series of equations and "solutions" is insufficient.  Each report should introduce the problem and any assumptions, detail the methodology, and discuss the results and conclusions.  Use full sentences, not bullet points.  Imagine your audience to be a colleague or supervisor—someone who understands your field but is not necessarily familiar with the details of your particular problem.  Why a report format?  You will learn deeper by having to explain in words, you will improve your writing skills, it will better prepare you for the type of work you will have in an engineering career, and the hard work you did will be much more accessible to you when referring to it later.  </p>

<p>Working with others on homework is certainly encouraged, but you must prepare your own reports.  <strong>Use of solution manuals or homework from prior students is considered a violation of the honor code.</strong></p>

<p>One or two of the assignments will involve a collaboration with students in Dr. Salmon's section of ME EN 273 (Intro to Sci Computing).  This will give you an opportunity to explain concepts and mentor others, which is one of the most effective ways to learn, and the opportunity to delegate portions of the problem, allowing you to tackle a richer, more interesting problem. The scientific computing students will benefit from exposure to applications in fluid mechanics they have not learned yet, adding context and motivation to what they are studying, and the opportunity to receive direct mentoring from others who recently learned the material themselves.</p>

<!-- , which adds a valuable perspective different from that of the course instructor. -->

<h3 id="project">Project</h3>

<p>You will work in teams of size 2 to deeply explore a fluid dynamic application of interest.  You will produce an end product with the goal to help others learn about your application.  The medium of this product is up to you.  Examples include: a report, a video, a poster, a tutorial, etc.  Final products will be made available publicly unless extenuating circumstances exist.  You will also have an opportunity to give a brief in-class presentation.  More details on this project are available in the <a href="../assignments">Assignments</a> section.</p>

<h3 id="quizzes-and-exams">Quizzes and Exams</h3>

<p>There will be frequent quizzes to engage your thinking on important concepts, assess your understanding, and practice for the exams.  Quizzes will be partially graded for correctness and partially for participation.  There will be two midterm exams and one comprehensive final exam.  </p>

<h3 id="advice">Advice</h3>

<p>Two things you'll quickly learn as you move into your first job, if you haven't learned them already, is that there is rarely a "right answer", and working well with others is essential.  Excellent engineers take the time to deeply understand the problem before trying to find solutions, are able to clearly justify their selected methodology, and can carefully present their findings.  Learn from and help your peers.  Get to know the TAs and the instructor in office hours.  Don't be afraid to ask for help.  </p>

<!-- Focus less on reaching a preconceived final answer and focus more on understanding the process.   -->

<p>Strong technical writing skills will be vital in your career and are often under-appreciated by engineering students.  Take advantage of opportunities to practice your writing and oral communication skills and learn how to express ideas clearly.  Scientific programming skills are also highly valued.  Many students understand syntax, but fewer can debug effectively and organize code clearly and logically.  </p>

<p>Worry less about grades and more about learning.  Have fun!  Find things that interest you and take the initiative to dive deeper!</p>

<h3 id="piazza">Piazza</h3>

<p>To assist you in asking for and giving help, we will be using Piazza. Piazza is a discussion forum and will allow you to get help efficiently from other classmates, the TA, and myself.  Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, please post your questions on Piazza (we will of course still have office hours).  After signing up for an account, and may want to visit your notification preferences.  All class announcements will come through Piazza.  Our class page can be found at: <a href="https://piazza.com/byu/fall2015/meen412/home">https://piazza.com/byu/fall2015/meen412/home</a></p>

<!-- Any application involving fluid mechanics is acceptable, but choose something you are excited about.  You will prepare a "handout" that other students could read to learn about your application.  You can include any elements (e.g., text, figures, videos, examples, quizes, etc.) that you think would be helpful to assist someone else in their learning.  The handout can be delivered in any format that you think is most effective to aid someone else's learning: text document, presentation, web page, etc.  You will have the opportunity to read two handouts from other groups and will provide feedback.  During the last two days of class each team will have a  -->

<!-- - Learn StarCCM+, Labs.
- Open Syllabus.  Students decide rules.  Late policy on assignments.  Exam format.  
- Project: students prepare notes on any fluid application.  Teams of 2.  Prepare handout (LaTeX, Word, IPython notebook).  Last two days of class you will have 1-2 slides and 4 minutes to present.

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-7">Schedule</h2>

<p>Please see Learning Suite for the current schedule.</p>

<h2 id="tocAnchor-1-1-8">University Policies</h2>

<h3 id="honor-code">Honor Code</h3>

<p>In keeping with the principles of the BYU Honor Code, students are expected to be honest in all of their academic work. Academic honesty means, most fundamentally, that any work you present as your own must in fact be your own work and not that of another. Violations of this principle may result in a failing grade in the course and additional disciplinary action by the university. Students are also expected to adhere to the Dress and Grooming Standards. Adherence demonstrates respect for yourself and others and ensures an effective learning and working environment. It is the university's expectation, and every instructor's expectation in class, that each student will abide by all Honor Code standards. Please call the Honor Code Office at 422-2847 if you have questions about those standards.</p>

<h3 id="sexual-harassment">Sexual Harassment</h3>

<p>Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits sex discrimination against any participant in an educational program or activity that receives federal funds. The act is intended to eliminate sex discrimination in education and pertains to admissions, academic and athletic programs, and university-sponsored activities. Title IX also prohibits sexual harassment of students by university employees, other students, and visitors to campus. If you encounter sexual harassment or gender-based discrimination, please talk to your professor or contact one of the following: the Title IX Coordinator at 801-422-2130; the Honor Code Office at 801-422-2847; the Equal Employment Office at 801-422-5895; or Ethics Point at <a href="http://www.ethicspoint.com">http://www.ethicspoint.com</a>, or 1-888-238-1062 (24-hours).</p>

<h3 id="student-disability">Student Disability</h3>

<p>Brigham Young University is committed to providing a working and learning atmosphere that reasonably accommodates qualified persons with disabilities. If you have any disability which may impair your ability to complete this course successfully, please contact the University Accessibility Center (UAC), 2170 WSC or 422-2767. Reasonable academic accommodations are reviewed for all students who have qualified, documented disabilities. The UAC can also assess students for learning, attention, and emotional concerns. Services are coordinated with the student and instructor by the UAC. If you need assistance or if you feel you have been unlawfully discriminated against on the basis of disability, you may seek resolution through established grievance policy and procedures by contacting the Equal Employment Office at 422-5895, D-285 ASB.</p>

<h3 id="academic-honesty">Academic Honesty</h3>

<p>The first injunction of the Honor Code is the call to "be honest." Students come to the university not only to improve their minds, gain knowledge, and develop skills that will assist them in their life's work, but also to build character. "President David O. McKay taught that character is the highest aim of education" (The Aims of a BYU Education, p.6). It is the purpose of the BYU Academic Honesty Policy to assist in fulfilling that aim. BYU students should seek to be totally honest in their dealings with others. They should complete their own work and be evaluated based upon that work. They should avoid academic dishonesty and misconduct in all its forms, including but not limited to plagiarism, fabrication or falsification, cheating, and other academic misconduct.</p>

<h3 id="devotional-attendance">Devotional Attendance</h3>

<p>Brigham Young University's devotional and forum assemblies are an important part of your BYU experience. President Cecil O. Samuelson said, "We have special and enlightening series of devotional and forum assemblies...that will complement, supplement, and enrich what will also be a very productive period in your classrooms, laboratories, and libraries. We look forward to being with you each Tuesday...and hope that you will regularly attend and bring your friends and associates with you...A large part of what constitutes the unique 'BYU experience' is found in these gatherings where the Spirit has been invited and where we have the opportunity to discuss and consider things of ultimate worth and importance that are not afforded to the academic community on almost any other campus" (from the address "The Legacy of Learning", 30 August, 2005). Your attendance at each forum and devotional is strongly encouraged.</p>

<h3 id="inappropriate-use-of-course-materials">Inappropriate Use Of Course Materials</h3>

<p>All course materials (e.g., outlines, handouts, syllabi, exams, quizzes, PowerPoint presentations, lectures, audio and video recordings, etc.) are proprietary. Students are prohibited from posting or selling any such course materials without the express written permission of the professor teaching this course. To do so is a violation of the Brigham Young University Honor Code.</p>

<h3 id="plagiarism">Plagiarism</h3>

<p>Intentional plagiarism is a form of intellectual theft that violates widely recognized principles of academic integrity as well as the Honor Code. Such plagiarism may subject the student to appropriate disciplinary action administered through the university Honor Code Office, in addition to academic sanctions that may be applied by an instructor. Inadvertent plagiarism, which may not be a violation of the Honor Code, is nevertheless a form of intellectual carelessness that is unacceptable in the academic community. Plagiarism of any kind is completely contrary to the established practices of higher education where all members of the university are expected to acknowledge the original intellectual work of others that is included in their own work. In some cases, plagiarism may also involve violations of copyright law. Intentional Plagiarism-Intentional plagiarism is the deliberate act of representing the words, ideas, or data of another as one's own without providing proper attribution to the author through quotation, reference, or footnote. Inadvertent Plagiarism-Inadvertent plagiarism involves the inappropriate, but non-deliberate, use of another's words, ideas, or data without proper attribution. Inadvertent plagiarism usually results from an ignorant failure to follow established rules for documenting sources or from simply not being sufficiently careful in research and writing. Although not a violation of the Honor Code, inadvertent plagiarism is a form of academic misconduct for which an instructor can impose appropriate academic sanctions. Students who are in doubt as to whether they are providing proper attribution have the responsibility to consult with their instructor and obtain guidance. Examples of plagiarism include: Direct Plagiarism-The verbatim copying of an original source without acknowledging the source. Paraphrased Plagiarism-The paraphrasing, without acknowledgement, of ideas from another that the reader might mistake for the author's own. Plagiarism Mosaic-The borrowing of words, ideas, or data from an original source and blending this original material with one's own without acknowledging the source. Insufficient Acknowledgement-The partial or incomplete attribution of words, ideas, or data from an original source. Plagiarism may occur with respect to unpublished as well as published material. Copying another student's work and submitting it as one's own individual work without proper attribution is a serious form of plagiarism.</p>

<hr />

<p>Now that we can evaluate the aerodynamic performance of airfoils we can improve our drag estimation. For this analysis we will use the wing from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_DC-3">Douglas DC-3</a>, a very successful plane that helped make air travel popular in the U.S. Some key specs, dimensions, and airfoil schedule are below (the below picture is simplified for the purposes of this homework both in number of airfoils and chord distribution).</p>

  <li>
    <p>Start with early conceptual design level.  Reuse the same parasitic drag methods from the last homework.  To keep it simple, use a sweep of zero (the Mach number is low enough that the sweep angle wouldn’t make much difference in these calculations), and use an average airfoil thickness.  Assume fully turbulent for simplicity, though that’s too conservative for a transport aircraft.  Next, we compute induced drag. At early design we’d have to assume an inviscid span efficiency (assume einv = 0.98, which is a typical value corresponding to a near-elliptic lift distribution).  While we now have viscous drag (with no lift), and lift-dependent drag (with no viscosity), we have to consider the interaction: viscous-lift-dependent drag.  In class, we talked about a rough early-design method: \({C_D}_{lift, viscous} = K {C_D}_p C_L^2\), where \({C_D}_p\) is the parasitic drag coefficient, and a typical value for \(K\) is 0.38.  Add this to the parasitic drag, resulting in total viscous drag (we could add it to either term, or really just add all three together for total drag, but adding it this way will facilitate later comparison with XFLR5).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the last homework we learned how to analyze airfoils, so we could use that type of analysis to improve our drag calculation.  The induced drag (inviscid) calculation is unchanged.  We can compute the viscous drag of the wing, by integrating the drag of the airfoils, Recall that (just using the definition of drag coefficient for an airfoil):</p>

\[D = \int D^\prime dy = \int c_d q_\infty c dy\]

    <p>When you integrate, don’t just use the two end sections.  You should interpolate at various points along the wing to compute a more accurate integral.
 From the figure we see that the chord varies linearly.  We can compute the lift coefficient distribution along the wing, by assuming an elliptic lift distribution.  The result is:</p>

\[c_l = \frac{4}{\pi}\frac{C_L \bar{c}}{c} \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{2y}{b}\right)^2}\]

    <p>where \(\bar{c}\) is the average chord \(S/b\) and \(c\) is the local chord, and \(C_L\) is the wing lift coefficient.  Once we know the local lift coefficient \(c_l\), we can interpolate airfoil data to find the local airfoil drag coefficient \(c_d\).  To save time, I ran the two airfoils in XFLR5 for you, at an average Reynolds number for this problem.  To further simplify the integration, I averaged the airfoil data so that we could treat the wing as having a constant “average” airfoil. The tabulated airfoil data is below:</p>

    <p>Since this integration is using airfoil data, the integration gives you total viscous drag, meaning the parasitic part (viscous drag no lift), plus the viscous-lift-dependent part directly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let’s now compute drag using XFLR5.  XFLR5 uses the same process as the prior problem, but with more accuracy (uses the local Reynolds number at each airfoil rather an average Reynolds number, uses separate airfoil information at each station instead of one average airfoil, computes an actual lift distribution to compute einv instead of assuming an elliptic distribution).  The most helpful overview videos from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtl5ylS6jdP6uOxzSJKPnUsvMbkmalfKg">official set</a> are 2, 6–8.  We don’t need to do any of the inertial properties as shown in video 7 (but will in a future homework).  Instead, for the analysis we are doing in this homework we can just enter the mass as a lump sum later in ``define an analysis’’.</p>

    <p>Airfoils: you need to do the airfoil batch analysis before you can do the wing analysis.  Type 1.  Make sure to run a wide range of angles of attack and Reynolds numbers.</p>

    <p>Wing: For Polar Type I prefer type 2 in this case, but you could do type 1.  Either way you’ll have to iterate on angle of attack.  Either to find the right speed for a fixed lift (when running type 2), or to find the right lift for a fixed speed (when running type 1). Select VLM1 as the Analysis type.  Make sure to choose a viscous option.   Enter the mass under inertia, and set your atmospheric properties.  When iterating on angle of attack it’ll be helpful to run coarse at first (say every degree or two), then narrow it down and run a finer resolution (like every 0.1 degrees).</p>

    <p>Report the inviscid induced drag (ICD in XFLR5, you’ll need to unnormalize), and viscous drag (VCD, this also includes viscous lift-dependent drag).  Compare to your estimates across all three parts.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<!-- 3. Since we've run XFLR5 already, let's take a look at the lift distribution (see the furthest left button called OpPoint View).  If you right click on a graph and click Current Graph then Define Graph Settings you can alternate between plotting lift ($$c_l \cdot c / mac$$) and the lift coefficient. Provide the following:

    - A plot of the lift distribution at the design speed. Report the corresponding inviscid span efficiency (called Efficiency in XFLR5).
    - A plot of the lift coefficient distribution such that the airfoil (note lowercase) $${c_l}_{max} = 1.2$$, which is around where the NACA 2206 stalls.  Report your wing (note uppercase): $${C_L}_{max}$$.
    - It is instructive to change twist and chord and observe the impact on the lift distribution and lift coefficient distribution, though there won't be anything to turn in. -->

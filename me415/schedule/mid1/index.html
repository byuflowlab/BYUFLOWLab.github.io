      <h1 id="preliminary-design-review-and-midterm-1">Preliminary Design Review and Midterm 1</h1>

<p>Your homework for this week is to prepare for the design review, prepare for the midterm, and take the midterm.</p>

<h3 id="preliminary-design-review">Preliminary Design Review</h3>

<p>Put together a presentation for the design review.  You won’t be graded on your presentation or on the quality of your design.  The grade is solely based on partcipating (each person on your team needs to participate).  The purpose of the review is to have a dialogue to allow for helpful feedback and answering of questions.  In other words, you don’t need to spend time making fancy slides, but you do need to present key information clearly so that we can have a meaningful discussion.  At a minimum, I recommend including the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Multiple views of your design and your overarching configuration rationale.</li>
  <li>Estimated total weight, the weight of key components, and the center of mass location.</li>
  <li>Estimated lift to drag ratio.</li>
  <li>Design speed and stall speed.</li>
  <li>Airfoil design and rationale including lift curve, drag polar, and moment curve.</li>
  <li>Wing design and rationale including lift and cl distributions.</li>
  <li>Tail and Fuselage design and rationale including open loop stability plot, static margin, and key stability derivatives.</li>
  <li>Any other unique design aspects.</li>
</ul>

<p>We will split the teams into three groups between myself and the two TAs.  Your team will have 15 minutes for the in-class review.</p>

<h3 id="midterm-1">Midterm 1</h3>

<p>The midterm is a take-home timed exam administered via Learning Suite.  The exam is closed book and open calculator and focuses on demonstrating understanding of important fundamental concepts.  These will be like the quiz questions.  I expect most people will finish in a little over an hour, but you will have up to 2 hours if needed.  The exam will be available on Learning Suite starting after class on Wednesday and must be completed before class next Wednesday (10/18/2017). You can take it anytime you wish during that interval, but must do so in one sitting.</p>

<!-- There are two parts.  

- Part I is closed book and open calculator and focuses on demonstrating understanding of important fundamental concepts.  These will be like the quiz questions.  You will have 30 minutes to complete this section.  
- Part II is open book, open notes, open calculator and focuses on solving flight vehicle design problems.  These will be like the homework problems but of smaller scope.  You won't need a computer.  You are welcome to use a computer, but only to access the allowed resources (textbook, notes, calculator).  You will have 1.5 hours to complete this section. -->

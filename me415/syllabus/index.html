<p>ME EN 415: Flight Vehicle Design<br />
Fall 2019<br />
Andrew Ning</p>

<h4 id="what-is-this-course-about">What is this course about?</h4>

<p>The subject of this course is aircraft and rocket design.  You will learn some of the basics of aerodynamics, structures, stability, propulsion, and performance as applied to flight vehicle design.  In other words, you will be exposed to the fundamentals of aerospace engineering.  A major component of the course is a hands-on, team project where you will design, build, and fly a small uninhabited aerial vehicle (UAV) to complete a specified mission.  The UAV is not the goal of the class per se, but through the project you will be able to apply and demonstrate principles you learn in the class.  While we don’t have time in one semester to also build a rocket, many of the concepts are transferable to rockets, and we will spend a few weeks specifically focused on rocket analysis and design.</p>

<h4 id="how-does-this-course-relate-to-other-courses">How does this course relate to other courses?</h4>

<p>The content of this class is the typical launching point for a mechanical engineer wishing to specialize in aerospace engineering.  Subsequent courses provide greater depth on topics that we can only cover at an introductory level in this class: aerodynamics (515), gas turbine and jet engine design (426), compressible fluid flow (510), computational fluid dynamics (541), design optimization (575), composites (456, 602), aircraft structures (523), control systems (431), flight dynamics and control (634).</p>

<h4 id="what-are-the-prerequisites">What are the prerequisites?</h4>

<p>Formally, the listed prerequisites are: ME EN 273, ME EN 312.  The latter may be taken concurrently, but you will need to read ahead to familiarize yourself with <a href="../schedule/review">some concepts</a> from that course.  We do <em>not</em> assume any prior exposure to aircraft or spacecraft.</p>

<p>Some of you are from other departments, like physics.  You’ll be just fine, though you should ask your classmates for help, as needed, in explaining some engineering concepts or terminology from fluids, dynamics, and structures that are re-used in this class.</p>

<h4 id="what-will-the-in-class-experience-be-like">What will the in-class experience be like?</h4>

<p>Don’t expect a passive experience.  I love this topic and can easily talk about it for 50 minutes, but it’s not going to be as great of a learning experience if you just listen to me talk the whole time.  Instead, classes will be oriented around <em>self-discovery</em>.  I’d actually prefer that you <em>did not</em> read the textbook beforehand.  The concepts will stick with you better if you wrestle with them before learning the “right way” to think about them.  To that end, in class I will ask lots of questions, ask you to predict things, draw charts, debate concepts with your neighbor, or solve problems that you haven’t seen before.  Lecture will still be necessary, but will hopefully be reduced in favor of more time actively exploring.  After class, the textbook is available to help you review or fill in details as needed.  When possible I also plan to provide summary videos as a supplementary resource.</p>

<p>Please ask lots of questions!  Especially ask the questions you think are “dumb” or “simple”, I guarantee someone else is wondering the same thing and you’re doing them a favor by asking.  Some of the work we will do requires a computer.  There are a few computers in the classroom that can be used, but if you have access to a laptop it will generally be helpful to bring it.</p>

<h4 id="what-textbook-will-we-use">What textbook will we use?</h4>

<p>I’ve developed a text specifically for this class that you can download <a href="https://byu.box.com/v/me415book">here</a>.  I’ve developed a textbook because: 1) I’d like to eliminate textbook costs to save you money and redirect some of those costs towards purchasing UAV components (more on this below), 2) There is no <em>one</em> textbook at the appropriate level or with the right mix of topics for this class, and purchasing multiple textbooks would be expensive, and 3) tailoring the content to exactly what we need will make your study more efficient and allow for more effective exploration.</p>

<p>I do recommend <em>Introduction to Flight</em> by John Anderson (any edition) as a supplementary text.  It is not necessary for the class, but will provide more context for those interested in exploring this topic further.  The level of the text is a bit too basic for our needs, but does provide a nice introduction to a broad range of topics.</p>

<h4 id="what-about-the-labs">What about the labs?</h4>

<p>The labs are supplementary—the lab hour is effectively just another office hour (it’s just a convenient time when many are available).  The only purpose of the labs is to help streamline homework or the project. There is important information associated with the labs, but we will make that information available in the form of handouts/videos so nothing is missed by not being at the “lab hour”.</p>

<h4 id="what-are-the-material-costs">What are the material costs?</h4>

<p>You will need to purchase most of the materials for your UAV (and will keep them).  We will provide access to tools and a transmitter for use during the semester.  You should not spend more than $50 per individual (or $250 per team).</p>

<!-- #### How time-intensive will this class be?

The time commitment for any undergraduate class should be pretty standard.  The level of time commitment expected by the [university](http://registrar.byu.edu/catalog/2011-2012ucat/GeneralInfo/Registration.php) is:

> The expectation for undergraduate courses is three hours of work per week per credit hour for the average student who is appropriately prepared; much more time may be required to achieve excellence.

Across the last two years, students have reported spending 10.6 hours per week on average (compared to the minimum university requirement of 9, and the department average of 10.3).  In other words, the average is pretty normal, but I suspect that that the open-ended nature of the project, and the complexity of team dynamics, means there may be significant variance.  -->

<h4 id="what-is-the-hardest-aspect-of-this-class">What is the hardest aspect of this class?</h4>

<p>One of the aspects students find hard about this class is that much of it is open ended.  You may be used to, and comfortable with, prescribed approaches to solving homework problems.  Aircraft design is complex, and most of the time I cannot provide you with a one-size-fits-all approach.  Or, if I did, it would often be wrong and misleading.  It’s a lot like the quote from Joseph Smith: ``I teach them correct principles, and they govern themselves.’’  You’ll learn principles in this class, and will need to wrestle some with how to apply them.  Understandably, your inexperience will make it hard to always know how to use them, but we (instructor, TAs, fellow classmates) are here to help.</p>

<p>You should expect some messiness and set backs and will likely even crash your UAV into the ground!  Don’t worry: this is normal, expected, and even desirable as part of the learning process.  We tend to learn the most from our mistakes.</p>

<!-- Sometimes this question is really code for what grade can I expect.  I can't answer that individually, but collectively I can say that the average grade for this class was a little above department/college averages for an upper division undergraduate course. -->

<h4 id="what-is-homework-like-and-when-is-it-due">What is homework like and when is it due?</h4>

<p>There will generally be a weekly assignment due every Wednesday at midnight (actually 11:59pm) via Learning Suite.  Many of the problems will help you make progress on your project, though there will be some broader problems as well.</p>

<p>Last year’s assignments will still be up on the website for about a week so you can get a feel for them.  This year’s assignments will be similar, but not exactly the same.</p>

<h4 id="what-about-late-work">What about late work?</h4>

<p>Late homework will be accepted with a penalty of 20% per day.  Last minute issues often happen in life so be sure to start your work early and submit early!  Despite your best planning you will likely have an unexpected event, obligation, or illness pop up.  To help with this, I will give you three free late days.  This policy is designed to help with unexpected issues so please don’t ask for homework extensions or other exceptions (unless you have an extreme or extended event like a hospitalization or death in the family).</p>

<h4 id="can-i-work-with-others--what-about-student-work-from-prior-years">Can I work with others?  What about student work from prior years?</h4>

<p>Working with others on homework is definitely encouraged, but you must do your own write-ups.  <strong>Referring to solution manuals or student work from previous years is a violation of department policy and the honor code.</strong></p>

<h4 id="what-format-should-the-homework-be-in">What format should the homework be in?</h4>

<p>Assignments are expected to be produced in a report or memo format.  A series of equations and “solutions” is insufficient.  Each report should introduce the problem and any assumptions, detail the methodology, and discuss the results and conclusions (the <a href="http://me.byu.edu/sites/default/files/What%20Is%20IMRaD.pdf">IMRaD</a> format).  <a href="https://byu.box.com/s/0l6z1i0twr82gxsim3c179q3pzr4tu0x">Here</a> is an example solution from a question I asked in a different class.  No need to go overboard with this, but in general, many students do not provide sufficient detail on their first homework and/or provide figures that are not clearly presented.  Presenting results clearly is an important skill you need to learn as you transition to industry or graduate school.  Clearly describing your work in the homeworks will also save you time when putting together the final project report.</p>

<h4 id="how-will-we-progress-on-the-project">How will we progress on the project?</h4>

<p>It is up to you to exercise discipline and set aside regular time to make progress (even when the final deadline is far away).  The homework assignments will often directly help, and there will be two design reviews with some associated milestones to help keep you on track.</p>

<h4 id="what-about-exams">What about exams?</h4>

<p>There will be two midterm exams and one comprehensive final exam.  The format has not yet been determined.
<!-- , but will likely be timed exams on Learning Suite. --></p>

<p>There will be periodic quizzes to help you and I gauge understanding and reinforce concepts.  Quizzes will be low weight and will be graded solely on participation.  Schedule a reminder because we won’t open up late quizzes after they are due (it becomes a logistical pain that isn’t justifiable giving the small number of points).  Instead, I will drop two quizzes because we all forget or have emergencies occasionally.</p>

<h4 id="how-will-i-be-graded">How will I be graded?</h4>

<p>Many (but not all) problems don’t have a “correct answer”, as is generally true in real-world engineering.  Primarily we are looking for good engineering work: clarity, justifiable assumptions, technically sound procedures, critical evaluation of the results.  Be sure that you address each item asked for in the problem statement.</p>

<p>Project milestones have rubrics attached to them.</p>

<!-- Because of the logistics required in grading 40+ exams, much of the exams will be built around correct answers.   -->

<p>The approximate percent breakdown is: 40% homework, 40% exams, 20% project.</p>

<!-- ### How can I get help?

I will have office hours, as will the TAs.  Additionally, we use [Piazza](https://piazza.com/byu/fall2018/meen415) to assist you in asking for and giving help.  Piazza is a discussion forum and will allow you to get help efficiently from other classmates, the TA, and myself.  Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, please post your questions on Piazza.  After signing up for an account, you may wish to visit your notification preferences (I prefer batch notifications).  **We also use Piazza for all class announcements, so be sure to sign up!** -->

<h3 id="university-and-department-policies">University and Department Policies</h3>

<h4 id="honor-code">Honor Code</h4>

<p>In keeping with the principles of the BYU Honor Code, students are expected to be honest in all of their academic work. Academic honesty means, most fundamentally, that any work you present as your own must in fact be your own work and not that of another. Violations of this principle may result in a failing grade in the course and additional disciplinary action by the university. Students are also expected to adhere to the Dress and Grooming Standards. Adherence demonstrates respect for yourself and others and ensures an effective learning and working environment. It is the university’s expectation, and every instructor’s expectation in class, that each student will abide by all Honor Code standards. Please call the Honor Code Office at 422-2847 if you have questions about those standards.</p>

<h4 id="academic-honesty-department">Academic Honesty (Department)</h4>

<p>As part of an overall teaching/learning approach to aid student learning, the course instructor may make available to students solutions to some prior coursework. However, outside of this appropriate usage, relying on and/or copying solutions (obtained online or from any source) to assigned coursework represents a clear example of turning in work that is not your own.</p>

<h4 id="inappropriate-use-of-course-materials">Inappropriate Use Of Course Materials</h4>

<p>All course materials (e.g., outlines, handouts, syllabi, exams, quizzes, PowerPoint presentations, lectures, audio and video recordings, etc.) are proprietary. Students are prohibited from posting or selling any such course materials without the express written permission of the professor teaching this course. To do so is a violation of the Brigham Young University Honor Code.</p>

<h4 id="preventing--responding-to-sexual-misconduct">Preventing &amp; Responding to Sexual Misconduct</h4>

<p>In accordance with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, Brigham Young University prohibits unlawful sex discrimination against any participant in its education programs or activities. The university also prohibits sexual harassment-including sexual violence-committed by or against students, university employees, and visitors to campus. As outlined in university policy, sexual harassment, dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking are considered forms of “Sexual Misconduct” prohibited by the university.</p>

<p>University policy requires all university employees in a teaching, managerial, or supervisory role to report all incidents of Sexual Misconduct that come to their attention in any way, including but not limited to face-to-face conversations, a written class assignment or paper, class discussion, email, text, or social media post. Incidents of Sexual Misconduct should be reported to the Title IX Coordinator at t9coordinator@byu.edu or (801) 422-8692. Reports may also be submitted through EthicsPoint at https://titleix.byu.edu/report or 1-888-238-1062 (24-hours a day).</p>

<p>BYU offers confidential resources for those affected by Sexual Misconduct, including the university’s Victim Advocate, as well as a number of non-confidential resources and services that may be helpful. Additional information about Title IX, the university’s Sexual Misconduct Policy, reporting requirements, and resources can be found at http://titleix.byu.edu or by contacting the university’s Title IX Coordinator.</p>

<h4 id="student-disability">Student Disability</h4>

<p>Brigham Young University is committed to providing a working and learning atmosphere that reasonably accommodates qualified persons with disabilities. If you have any disability which may impair your ability to complete this course successfully, please contact the University Accessibility Center (UAC), 2170 WSC or 422-2767. Reasonable academic accommodations are reviewed for all students who have qualified, documented disabilities. The UAC can also assess students for learning, attention, and emotional concerns. Services are coordinated with the student and instructor by the UAC. If you need assistance or if you feel you have been unlawfully discriminated against on the basis of disability, you may seek resolution through established grievance policy and procedures by contacting the Equal Employment Office at 422-5895, D-285 ASB.</p>

<h4 id="respectful-environment">Respectful Environment</h4>

<p>“Sadly, from time to time, we do hear reports of those who are at best insensitive and at worst insulting in their comments to and about others… We hear derogatory and sometimes even defamatory comments about those with different political, athletic, or ethnic views or experiences. Such behavior is completely out of place at BYU, and I enlist the aid of all to monitor carefully and, if necessary, correct any such that might occur here, however inadvertent or unintentional. “I worry particularly about demeaning comments made about the career or major choices of women or men either directly or about members of the BYU community generally. We must remember that personal agency is a fundamental principle and that none of us has the right or option to criticize the lawful choices of another.” President Cecil O. Samuelson, Annual University Conference, August 24, 2010 “Occasionally, we … hear reports that our female faculty feel disrespected, especially by students, for choosing to work at BYU, even though each one has been approved by the BYU Board of Trustees. Brothers and sisters, these things ought not to be. Not here. Not at a university that shares a constitution with the School of the Prophets.” Vice President John S. Tanner, Annual University Conference, August 24, 2010</p>

<h4 id="devotional-attendance">Devotional Attendance</h4>

<p>Brigham Young University’s devotional and forum assemblies are an important part of your BYU experience. President Cecil O. Samuelson said, “We have special and enlightening series of devotional and forum assemblies…that will complement, supplement, and enrich what will also be a very productive period in your classrooms, laboratories, and libraries. We look forward to being with you each Tuesday…and hope that you will regularly attend and bring your friends and associates with you…A large part of what constitutes the unique ‘BYU experience’ is found in these gatherings where the Spirit has been invited and where we have the opportunity to discuss and consider things of ultimate worth and importance that are not afforded to the academic community on almost any other campus” (from the address “The Legacy of Learning”, 30 August, 2005). Your attendance at each forum and devotional is strongly encouraged.</p>

<h4 id="mental-health">Mental Health</h4>

<p>Mental health concerns and stressful life events can affect students’ academic performance and quality of life. BYU Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS, 1500 WSC, 801-422-3035, caps.byu.edu) provides individual, couples, and group counseling, as well as stress management services. These services are confidential and are provided by the university at no cost for full-time students. For general information please visit https://caps.byu.edu; for more immediate concerns please visit http://help.byu.edu.</p>

<h4 id="academic-honesty">Academic Honesty</h4>

<p>The first injunction of the Honor Code is the call to “be honest.” Students come to the university not only to improve their minds, gain knowledge, and develop skills that will assist them in their life’s work, but also to build character. “President David O. McKay taught that character is the highest aim of education” (The Aims of a BYU Education, p.6). It is the purpose of the BYU Academic Honesty Policy to assist in fulfilling that aim. BYU students should seek to be totally honest in their dealings with others. They should complete their own work and be evaluated based upon that work. They should avoid academic dishonesty and misconduct in all its forms, including but not limited to plagiarism, fabrication or falsification, cheating, and other academic misconduct.</p>

<h4 id="plagiarism">Plagiarism</h4>

<p>Intentional plagiarism is a form of intellectual theft that violates widely recognized principles of academic integrity as well as the Honor Code. Such plagiarism may subject the student to appropriate disciplinary action administered through the university Honor Code Office, in addition to academic sanctions that may be applied by an instructor. Inadvertent plagiarism, which may not be a violation of the Honor Code, is nevertheless a form of intellectual carelessness that is unacceptable in the academic community. Plagiarism of any kind is completely contrary to the established practices of higher education where all members of the university are expected to acknowledge the original intellectual work of others that is included in their own work. In some cases, plagiarism may also involve violations of copyright law. Intentional Plagiarism-Intentional plagiarism is the deliberate act of representing the words, ideas, or data of another as one’s own without providing proper attribution to the author through quotation, reference, or footnote. Inadvertent Plagiarism-Inadvertent plagiarism involves the inappropriate, but non-deliberate, use of another’s words, ideas, or data without proper attribution. Inadvertent plagiarism usually results from an ignorant failure to follow established rules for documenting sources or from simply not being sufficiently careful in research and writing. Although not a violation of the Honor Code, inadvertent plagiarism is a form of academic misconduct for which an instructor can impose appropriate academic sanctions. Students who are in doubt as to whether they are providing proper attribution have the responsibility to consult with their instructor and obtain guidance. Examples of plagiarism include: Direct Plagiarism-The verbatim copying of an original source without acknowledging the source. Paraphrased Plagiarism-The paraphrasing, without acknowledgement, of ideas from another that the reader might mistake for the author’s own. Plagiarism Mosaic-The borrowing of words, ideas, or data from an original source and blending this original material with one’s own without acknowledging the source. Insufficient Acknowledgement-The partial or incomplete attribution of words, ideas, or data from an original source. Plagiarism may occur with respect to unpublished as well as published material. Copying another student’s work and submitting it as one’s own individual work without proper attribution is a serious form of plagiarism.</p>

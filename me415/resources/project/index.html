<hr />

<h4 id="overview">Overview</h4>

<p>Our project this year is to design, build, and fly a glider.  Your design must have at least a wing (no darts).  Our mission will be “glider golf”, which is like discus golf but with gliders, though we will just use simple circles made from cones rather than baskets.</p>

<p>You are welcome to use whatever materials you like in your construction.  Since you didn’t have to purchase a textbook you can think of your materials cost as your textbook fee.  You will self-select teams of 3.  With prior approval, teams of 4 allowed if your team wants to something more ambitious than normal.</p>

<!-- but you'll be limited in span to 7.5 ft -->

<h4 id="objective">Objective</h4>

<p>The main objective is to pass through the three holes in the least number of tosses.  Small bonuses may be awarded for exceptional design analysis, build quality, designs with a higher degree of difficulty, innovation, or anything else we find particularly impressive.</p>

<p>While definitely not expected, you are allowed to add servos/ailerons or even a motor and propeller(s) if you like.  Again, not expected.  It will increase the complexity of your build.  But if done well, it certainly can make the flights easier.  We have a radio transmitter that can be borrowed, or you can use your own.</p>

<h4 id="foam-cutter-info">Foam Cutter Info</h4>

<p>Use of the foam cutter is optional, but if you want to use it, sign up for a time with the TAs using this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSftZvF6KsY5AMrSCgT0FPQ3rLTss1F1pm49MMBN6uOdE_nqSg/viewform">link</a>.  You will need to come ready with your geometry fully defined in Devwing.  Download the software <a href="https://www.devcad.com/eng/download.asp">here</a>.  Scroll down and download Devwing Foam (version 2.07b).  You’ll have to use a computer with Windows on it.  Here is a tutorial: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjx6_OrfhVQ">part 1</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzr_LXEZwcs">part 2</a>. Keep in mind that each wing section has a maximum length of 762 mm (2.5 ft).  NGX 250 pink foam has a density of 1.54 lb/ft^3.  You can buy this foam at Home Depot or Lowes.  It comes in 4 ft x 8 ft sheets, so you will want to share with another team(s).  The ME checkout room may have some on hand that you can purchase from them.</p>

<h4 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h4>

<p>The following milestones are designed to help keep you on track.  But don’t feel limited by them.  For example, you might want to have part of your team start building some parts while you are still working out other aspects of the design.</p>

<h5 id="preliminary-design-review">Preliminary Design Review</h5>
<p>In class you will give a 10–15-minute presentation on your current design to one of the instructors.  We realize you may not be done with your design yet, but will give feedback on whatever you have ready to go.  The purpose of the review is to have a dialogue to allow for helpful feedback and to answer questions. You don’t need to spend time making fancy slides, but you do need to present key information clearly so that we can have a meaningful discussion. Here are some elements you should consider:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Multiple views of your design and your overarching configuration rationale</li>
  <li>Estimated total weight, the weight of key components, and the center of mass location.</li>
  <li>Estimated lift to drag ratio.</li>
  <li>Design speed and stall speed.</li>
  <li>Airfoil selection and rationale including lift curve, drag polar, and moment curve.</li>
  <li>Wing design and rationale including lift and cl distributions.</li>
  <li>Tail and Fuselage design (if applicable) and rationale including open loop stability plot, static margin, key stability derivatives.</li>
  <li>Any other unique design aspects.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="preliminary-build-review">Preliminary Build Review</h5>
<p>Like the design review you’ll have 10 or so minutes to present any components you’ve built and discuss other building plans.</p>

<h5 id="flyoff">Flyoff</h5>

<p>We’ll launch from the main pavilion in Rock Canyon park, and will allow two attempts (keep your best score).</p>

<h5 id="report">Report</h5>

<p>Most of the weight of the project is the report.  Submit a PDF (one per team) describing your design, build, and flyoff.  In addition to the design guidelines above, include multiple photos of the completed build and describe the details of your manufacturing process.  Describe any design changes that were made and include views of your design to compare to the actual build.</p>

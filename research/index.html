<p><img src="hover_iso.png" class="width-half" /></p>

<p>This multi-university-industry collaboration explores a comprehensive trade study of eVTOL configurations and develops an open-source multidisciplinary optimization framework for eVTOL design.  Models span a variety of disciplines including aerodynamics, acoustics, batteries, thermo-elastic-electromagnetic motor design, structural sizing, and vehicle performance.  Our lab is focused on steady and unsteady aerodynamic modeling, as well as optimization.</p>

<p><img src="wt_hills.png" class="width-half" /></p>

<p>In this project, we aim to explore a novel approach for the simulation of wind farms located in urban areas or complex terrain. It is based on a hybrid vortex particle-mesh method that has the capability of performing large medium-fidelity simulations while benefiting from a fast, scalable implementation. We focus on extending the original method to incorporate the effect of the atmospheric boundary layer, and to model rigid objects (like buildings) and/or uneven grounds. Our objective is then to leverage this tool to supplement the development of engineering models suitable for wind farm layout optimization in complex environments.</p>

<p><img src="vahana2.jpg" class="width-half" /></p>

<p>While standard design tools typically relegate acoustic analysis outside of the design loop, we are developing a framework that embeds physics-based broadband and tonal analyses for optimization in conceptual design. It incorporates open source and in-house-developed propulsive design tools across aerodynamics, acoustics, powertrain, and structures disciplines for the design of ultra-quiet propulsors for sUAS, eCTOL, and eVTOL aircraft. The framework allows designers to perform thrust, power, and weight tradeoffs in vehicle integration, while identifying and minimizing any non-aero-induced sources of noise and vibration.</p>

<p><img src="bigjared.png" class="width-half" /></p>

<p>We’ve been developing a new formulation for a viscous vortex particle method (VPM) that is numerically stable.  A VPM is based on solving the vorticity form of the Navier-Stokes equations, and, using a meshless Lagrangian scheme, can accurately preserve vortical structures and improve computational efficiency by placing particles only where needed.  This makes the method ideally suited for modeling free wakes.  This research is focused on fundamental developments in the VPM methodology and using it to better understand wind farm applications like mixed height wind farms, complex terrain, and partial waking.</p>

<p><img src="site_illu.png" class="width-half" /></p>

<p>This multi-university project aims to develop new techniques for the control co-design optimization of large scale floating wind turbines. We develop a framework to enable the simultaneous design of turbines and their control schemes, towards better global optima. Our lab is concerned with the heart of the multi-physics optimization problem, focusing on modeling aerodynamics. We work to leverage different gradient-based-enabled simulation tools (like BEM and RANS CFD) and to combine their outputs in a unique problem-solving approach.</p>

<p>Complex aerodynamic interactions from wakes interacting with wakes, and wakes interacting with lifting surfaces, are becoming more prevalent in emerging aircraft concepts. Over the last three years we have developed, verified, and validated a VPM.  This project is coupling the VPM to an acoustics solver and exploring a challenging airborne wind energy application, modeled as a wing with 8 rotors flying in a circular path.</p>

<p>Battery technology and autonomous control have advanced to a point where electric-powered passenger aircraft, with approximately 2–4 passengers (i.e., air taxis), are becoming feasible.  Electric motors scale very differently than gas turbine engines, and have very different power curves, allowing for things like short or even vertical takeoff and landing, and distributed propulsion (many small propellers instead of a few big propellers).  Distributed propulsion systems can allow for greater redundancy, control authority, performance, and maneuverability. However, operating many rotors in close proximity, or spread around the vehicle, creates strong aerodynamic interactions that are not well understood.  We are developing an analysis and design methodology based on a vortex particle method to more accurately capture wake interactions and perform novel design studies for air taxi applications.  Using electric motors affects all systems and thus completely changes the way the aircraft is designed.  We are exploring optimization-driven design studies to improve design strategies for electric powered aircraft.</p>

<p>Many UAS missions have competing objectives and those missions may be supported by different types of aircraft.  For example, consider a public service unit that needs to simultaneously monitor a wildfire, track a moving suspect, and search for a lost hiker.  We are working on methods to optimally fulfill multiple objectives, that are dynamic (e.g., priorities and tasks may change), and utilize a heterogenous fleet (e.g., fixed wing and rotorcraft).</p>

<p>Aircraft can be used to provide internet in developing areas of the world at a lower cost than deploying new satellites.  The challenge is that such aircraft need to be persistent (i.e., stay airborne for months at a time).  This drives the aircraft design to very large wing spans in order to reduce lift-dependent drag, and to very high altitudes where wind speeds are low.  The performance requirements are demanding necessitating a multidisciplinary design optimization approach considering tradeoffs in aerodynamic performance, structural dynamics, weight, solar energy capture, battery storage, electric propulsion, and cost.  We are developing design tools and methodologies, and working on different aircraft design concepts and strategies to help make telecommunication access available in more parts of the world.</p>

### Wind Farm Optimization

<img src="windfarm.png" class="width-half">

The wakes behind wind turbines reduce the potential power production of other turbines in the farm.  This problem is further complicated because the wind speed and direction change frequently both temporally and spatially.  Layout design seeks to reduce wake interactions through optimization.  This is a particularly challenging optimization problem.  The design space is filled with local optima and the problems may have hundreds of design variables and thousands of constraints.  We have been developing wake models that enable efficient optimization procedures and have been exploring design studies of large wind farms, including simultaneous design of the layout, the turbines themselves, and their orientations.

### Wind Turbine Design

<img src="vawt.jpg" class="width-half">

Wind turbines are complex multidisciplinary systems that operate in a fundamentally unsteady environment. Blade design is particularly challenging as the blades are often long and slender, make extensive use of composites, and are subject to cyclic and unsteady loading.  Similarly, towers must be strong and lightweight and drivetrains must withstand all required mechanical loads.  We develop efficient multidisciplinary models to capture complex aerodynamic, structural loading, and economic tradeoffs.  Using optimization we explore novel configurations and wind farms that use more than one type of turbine.   -->

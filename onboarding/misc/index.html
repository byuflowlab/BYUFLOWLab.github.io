<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Group meeting is not a status update.  If it was, we would just do it via email.  In our meeting we’d like to dive into the details of things that aren’t working, ask lots of questions, and discuss ideas.  This isn’t the time for polished or perfect results.  Pictures are more helpful than just words.  You should prepare at least one image (figure, chart, etc.) every time so we can see what’s going on.  It may be uncomfortable to share results that you know are “bad”, but if you learn to embrace the discomfort we will progress much more effectively.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Collaboration is a plus.  Don’t worry about your territory and whether or not someone else’s topic overlaps with your own.  Collaboration often leads to better ideas and better outcomes.  Just focus on doing good work, and it will all work out.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a 1 week internal deadline for any submissions that require my review (conference papers, theses, etc.) although 2 weeks is recommended.  That time is necessary to allow us to make changes and it is a <em>hard</em> deadline.  We’ve had soft deadlines in the past, but have found that we usually blow past them, leading to stressful last minute heroic efforts, and a reinforcement of less than desirable habits.  Better to make mistakes now while in school and develop the skills to plan and meet milestones comfortably.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Summer can be a highly productive time for accelerating your research, as it represents almost 50% of your work year.  However, a summer internship can still be worthwhile to pursue especially if it is aligned with your research, or is somewhere you want to work at after graduation.  Before applying, make sure you come meet with me so we can discuss timing, possible destinations, and any sponsor obligations that exist with your current funding.  Usually, there is only time for one internship as a graduate student (or perhaps two as PhD student) so we’ll want to make it count.  Generally it is more impactful towards the end of your graduate studies when they can evaluate you as a potential hire.  An alternative is a visiting researcher position, which may be even more valuable and can be more frequent because you will make progress in your research.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I encourage you to get know each other and catch up on each other’s work and personal lives.  One of the best treasures you’ll take away from your time as a graduate student (if you invest in it) is your relationships with your fellow labmates.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I encourage you to attend the BYU Devotionals/Forums. By attend, I mean actually go up to the Marriott Center and not just watch from your computer. It may feel difficult to give up an hour (and some weeks it may not work out), but I think you will find that it is time well spent. In addition to spiritual insights, I often receive promptings or ideas regarding our work. It is a special privilege to be there and one that can easily be taken for granted.  As a bonus, walking up together can be a great time to catch up (see previous point).</p>
